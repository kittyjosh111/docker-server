YOURLS (Your Own URL Shortener) is a free and open-source software that allows you to create and manage your own URL shortening service. It provides a simple and customizable solution for shortening long URLs into shorter, more manageable ones. 

This YOURLS instance has the  **"YOURLS Anonymize Plugin"**  loaded. This means that when you create a shortened link, this instance of YOURLS will  **not**  be able to associate your IP address, user-agent, or referrers to said shortened link.

This YOURLS instance has the  **"Login Timeout Plugin"**  loaded. This means that this instance of YOURLS will block your ip address from logging in for 3 hours if you type in the password wrong twice.

You do not need an account to be able to use this YOURLS instance.
