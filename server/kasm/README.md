### Kasm Workspaces
---

*Host your own instance [here](https://kasmweb.com/community-edition).*

Kasm Workspaces utilizes containerization to isolate individual user sessions. Each user is provided with a few applications running in their own dedicated container on the server, ensuring separation between the workspace and your device. This approach offers enhanced security, as any potential malicious activity or malware within one user's container is isolated and cannot affect other users or the underlying infrastructure. 

This instance of Kasm Workspaces supports user registration through Google or Github. Users will be able to create one workspace at a time, and are provided ready-to-go images of Ungoogled Chromium or Firefox. After 10 minutes of idle, the container will be deleted.
