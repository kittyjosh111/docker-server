Send is a file-sharing service initially created by Mozilla, then forked by the community. Through Send, you can upload a file and generate a unique link to share with others. The file remains available for download over a limited period of time or until a certain number of downloads are reached, after which it will be automatically deleted from the server. The current limits are 2.5 GB, 100 downloads, and 7 days storage. You don't need an account to use this service.
