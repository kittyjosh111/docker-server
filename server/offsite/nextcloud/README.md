### Nextcloud
---

*Host your own instance [here](https://nextcloud.com/install/#instructions-server).*

Nextcloud is a simple self-hosted, open-source file hosting and collaboration platform that allows you to store, share, and sync files and data across multiple devices and users. It provides similar functionality to popular cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive, but with the advantage of giving you full control over your data.

This instance of Nextcloud supports account registration using Google or Github. These users will be allocated 1 GB of storage.
